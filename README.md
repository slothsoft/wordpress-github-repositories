Just a silly project to see if I can create [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) plug-ins.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need at least WordPress 5.1, or at least that is the version I tested against.




### Installing

Installing "GitHub Repositories" can be done by using the following steps:

1. Download the plugin's ZIP via the green "Clone or download" button
1. Upload the ZIP file through the 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' screen in your WordPress dashboard
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress



### Using the Plug-in

You define the plug-in with the shortcut `list-github-repositories`. Don't forget to define the user whose plug-ins you want to display, else you'll get mine:

Afterwards you get a nice list with your repositories:
