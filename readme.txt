Just a silly project to see if I can create WordPress plug-ins.

## Description

You define the plug-in with the shortcut `list-github-repositories`. Don't forget to define the user whose plug-ins you want to display, else you'll get mine.

Afterwards you get a nice list with your repositories.

## Installation

Installing "GitHub Repositories" can be done by using the following steps:

1. Download the plugin's ZIP via the green "Clone or download" button
1. Upload the ZIP file through the 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' screen in your WordPress dashboard
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

## Screenshots

1. List GitHub Repositories in Editor
2. List GitHub Repositories in Action

## Changelog

### 1.0
* Initial release

## Upgrade Notice
 
### 1.0

This is the one and only version. Why wouldn't you use it?
